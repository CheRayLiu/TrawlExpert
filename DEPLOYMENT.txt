==== COMMAND LINE ====

In order to launch the command-line version of the TrawlExpert, launch src/main/Main.java
in Eclipse. This will load the command line tool with all the data needed to run the
program. Try typing "tree" and pressing Enter to see all of the possible searches in the
dataset. Then type "records Cottus cognatus" for example to search for a certain species.
Then you can type "histogram", "sum", "list" or "cluster 10000" for example to see different
results.

==== TOMCAT ====
Tomcat is significantly more tricky. It may not work depending on the local computer setup. 
There is a makefile that when run from the main project directory should allow the server to 
start. On Mac or Linux run go to the project directory and type `make start`. On Windows,
from the home directory of the project, run the command "tomcat\bin\startup.bat".

Accessing http://localhost:8080/Trawl should then load the website. 

However, the amount of time needed to properly configure tomcat on
your machine may not be worth taking the time to figure out. As such, a live version of the
website has been made available at http://trawl.schankula.ca/Trawl. This runs the exact same 
code as would run locally if you ran tomcat. 

For example, try selecting a species and then clicking 
"load" on the "list" and seeing how many results there are. Then try viewing histogram,
heat map, map, etc. For results greater than ~20,000 results, don't attempt to view the
heat map or map as this will likely lag your browser (the server-side code handles this fine;
the client can get laggy). Try out the clustering by typing in a value of at least 1,000km^2
for any size of search (even "any" for all fields). You can also try out filtering by year
and seeing that there are only results in those years. Lastly, for "cluster" and "map"
options, try clicking the map markers to see more information.
