# Code standards
* To keep our code somewhat "pretty" and to make it easier for us to 
read each other's code try to remember to use the `Source` -> `Format` 
(`Shift+Cmd/Ctrl+F`) option before committing.
* Use comments for anything particularly tricky or confusing.

# Respository guidelines / suggestions 
* Commit often -- don't write a bunch of code then commit
* Use descriptive commit messages
