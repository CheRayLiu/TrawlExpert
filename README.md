# 2XB3 Group 11 [Def. need a better name!] Repository
This is our repository for everything relating to our project for 2XB3.

# Opening this project in Eclipse
1. In Eclipse, click on File -> Open Projects from File System.
2. Beside "Import source" click on "Directory..."
3. Navigate to the repository on your hard drive (folder should be called 2XB3).
4. Click "Open" then "Finish"

Now you should be able to view and edit code :)

# Code standards
* To keep our code somewhat "pretty" and to make it easier for us to 
read each other's code try to remember to use the `Source` -> `Format` 
(`Shift+Cmd/Ctrl+F`) option before committing.
* Use comments for anything particularly tricky or confusing.

# Respository guidelines / suggestions 
* Commit often -- don't write a bunch of code then commit
* Use descriptive commit messages

# Other random things
* I have set the repository to ignore all files in the /bin/ directory. These 
files are generated automatically by Eclipse when you run your code; they're 
ananlogous to *.o files we dealt with in C last semester. Therefore, it is
pointless and a pain to include them in the repository. So you don't need to
try to `git add` these files and don't worry that they're not showing up on the
repository online.
